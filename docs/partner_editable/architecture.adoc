image::../images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones.
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Windows bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure
Remote Desktop (RDP) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.*
* In the private subnets:
** 2 EC2 instances with 3 Network interfaces each. (StarWind VSAN EC2 storage instances)
** 1 EC2 instance with 1 network interface. (StarWind VSAN EC2 Witness instance)
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.
// * <describe any additional components>.

[.small]#* The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
