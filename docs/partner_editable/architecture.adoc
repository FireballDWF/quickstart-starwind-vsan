.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../images/starwind_qs_architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones.
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Windows bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure
Remote Desktop (RDP) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.*
* In the private subnets:
** Two StarWind VSAN EC2 storage instances (nodes 1 and 2) in Availability Zones 1 and 3. These storage instances <do what?______>. 
** A StarWind VSAN EC2 witness instance in Availability Zone 2. This witness instance <does what?______>. 
** Two iSCSI elastic network interfaces in Availability Zones 1 and 3. These network interfaces <do what?______>.
** Three management/witness network interfaces in Availability Zones 1, 2, and 3, which <do what?______>.
** Two synchronization network interfaces in Availability Zones 1 and 3. These network interfaces <do what?______>.

//TODO Dave, In the diagram's public subnets, please add the NAT gateways, bastion host, and Auto Scaling group since we mention them in the bullets.

//TODO Dave, In the diagram, only two of the management/witness network interfaces have arrows. What about the third one ... is an arrow maybe implied between it and storage node 1?

//TODO Dave, In the bullet points above, please fill in the blanks.
