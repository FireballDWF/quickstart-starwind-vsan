This Quick Start provides two deployment options:

* *Deploy StarWind VSAN into a new VPC*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, remote desktop gateway hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys StarWind VSAN into this new VPC.
* *Deploy StarWind VSAN into an existing VPC*. This option deploys StarWind VSAN in your existing AWS infrastructure.

The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and StarWind VSAN settings, as discussed later in this guide.
